import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Diagrammer can be installed as a desktop application or run directly in your browser.

## Desktop Application (Recommended)

The desktop version provides the best performance and full feature access including native file system integration.

  <TabItem label="macOS">

    2. Open the `.dmg` and drag Diagrammer to your Applications folder

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Linux">
    **AppImage (Universal)**
    ```bash
    chmod +x Diagrammer-*.AppImage
    ./Diagrammer-*.AppImage
    ```

    **Debian/Ubuntu (.deb)**
    ```bash
    sudo dpkg -i diagrammer_*.deb
    ```

    **Fedora/RHEL (.rpm)**
    ```bash
    sudo rpm -i diagrammer-*.rpm
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Web Version

For quick access without installation, use the web version at:

```
https://QR-Madness.github.io/diagrammer/app
```

:::note
The web version has some limitations compared to the desktop app:
- No native file system access (uses browser storage)
- Cannot host collaboration sessions (can only join)
- Storage limited by browser quotas
