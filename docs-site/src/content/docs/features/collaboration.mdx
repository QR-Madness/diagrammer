Diagrammer supports real-time collaboration through **Protected Local mode**, allowing teams to work together on diagrams simultaneously.

## How It Works

Collaboration in Diagrammer uses a peer-to-peer architecture:

1. One user **hosts** the session (runs the server)
2. Other users **connect** to the host via WebSocket
3. Changes sync in real-time using **CRDTs** (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types)

<Aside type="tip">
  CRDT-based sync means you'll never lose work due to conflicts. Even if two people edit the same shape simultaneously, changes merge automatically.
</Aside>

## Hosting a Session

To share a document with collaborators:

<Steps>

1. **Open your document**
   
   Open the document you want to collaborate on.

2. **Start hosting**
   
   Go to **Collaborate → Start Hosting** or click the **Share** button in the toolbar.

3. **Configure access**
   
   Choose who can connect:
   - **Anyone with the link** - No authentication required
   - **Require authentication** - Users must log in with credentials you set

4. **Share the connection info**
   
   Copy the connection URL and share it with your team. It looks like:
   ```
   ws://192.168.1.100:8080/doc/abc123
   ```

</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
  Hosting is only available in the **desktop application**. The web version can join sessions but cannot host them.
</Aside>

## Joining a Session

To join someone else's session:

<Steps>

1. **Get the connection URL**
   
   Obtain the WebSocket URL from the host.

2. **Connect**
   
   Go to **Collaborate → Join Session** and paste the URL.
   
   Or click a `diagrammer://` link if the host shared one.

3. **Authenticate (if required)**
   
   Enter credentials if the host enabled authentication.

</Steps>

## Collaboration Features

### Live Cursors

See where other collaborators are working:

- Each user's cursor appears with their name
- Cursor colors are automatically assigned
- Cursors fade when idle

### Selection Awareness

Shared selection state prevents conflicts:

- See what others have selected (highlighted with their color)
- Shapes being actively edited show a lock indicator
- Attempting to edit a locked shape shows a notification

### Presence Indicators

The toolbar shows connected users:

- User avatars/initials with status
- Click to see full user list
- User colors match their cursor

### Real-time Sync

All changes sync instantly:

- Shape creation, modification, deletion
- Property changes (colors, text, etc.)
- Page additions and modifications
- Undo/redo (per-user history)

## Offline Support

Diagrammer works offline with automatic sync when reconnected.

### How Offline Mode Works

1. **Connection lost** - You can continue working normally
2. **Changes queued** - Your edits are saved locally in an offline queue
3. **Reconnection** - Changes automatically sync when connection returns
4. **Conflict resolution** - CRDTs merge changes without conflicts

### Offline Indicators

The status bar shows connection state:

- 🟢 **Connected** - Real-time sync active
- 🟡 **Reconnecting** - Attempting to reconnect (with retry count)
- 🔴 **Offline** - Working locally, changes will sync later

### Manual Reconnection

If automatic reconnection fails after several attempts:

1. Check your network connection
2. Verify the host is still running
3. Click **Reconnect** in the status bar
4. Or go to **Collaborate → Reconnect**

## Server Configuration

The host can configure server settings in **Settings → Collaboration**:

### Network Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Port** | WebSocket server port (default: 8080) |
| **Interface** | Network interface to bind (default: all) |
| **Max Connections** | Maximum concurrent users |

### Authentication

Enable JWT-based authentication:

1. Go to **Settings → Collaboration → Authentication**
2. Enable **Require Authentication**
3. Add users with usernames and passwords
4. Users must authenticate when connecting

### Access Control

Configure what connected users can do:

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **View** | Read-only access |
| **Edit** | Can modify shapes and pages |
| **Admin** | Full access including settings |

## Security Considerations

<Aside type="caution" title="Network Security">
  Collaboration connections are **not encrypted by default**. For sensitive documents:
  
  - Use on trusted networks only
  - Consider VPN for remote collaboration
  - Enable authentication
</Aside>

### Best Practices

1. **Use authentication** for any non-local collaboration
2. **Limit connections** to known users
3. **Use private networks** when possible
4. **Save local backups** before major collaboration sessions

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Connect

- Verify the connection URL is correct
- Check firewall allows the port (default: 8080)
- Ensure host and client are on the same network
- Try ping/telnet to verify network connectivity

### High Latency

- Check network bandwidth
- Reduce number of simultaneous connections
- Large documents may have slower initial sync

### Changes Not Syncing

- Check connection status in status bar
- Look for error notifications
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting
- Check host console for errors

### Duplicate Changes

If you see duplicate shapes or edits:

1. This is rare with CRDT sync
2. Try refreshing the document (`F5`)
3. Check if multiple browser tabs are open
4. Report persistent issues with document export
