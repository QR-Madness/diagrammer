Diagrammer is a fast, offline-first diagramming and whiteboard app. Whether you're sketching out a quick flowchart or building a complex enterprise architecture diagram, Diagrammer keeps things smooth — even with thousands of shapes on screen.

This guide walks you through everything Diagrammer can do. Use the sidebar to jump to any topic, or start with the [Quick Start](../quick-start) to create your first diagram in under five minutes.

## Why Diagrammer?

### Performance First

Unlike browser-based diagramming tools that slow down with complex diagrams, Diagrammer uses Canvas 2D rendering with spatial indexing (R-tree) to maintain **60fps with 10,000+ shapes**. This means:

- Smooth pan and zoom regardless of diagram complexity
- Instant shape selection and manipulation
- No lag when working with large enterprise diagrams

### Desktop & Web

Diagrammer runs as a **native desktop application** using Tauri (Rust backend), giving you:

- Native file system access
- System-level performance
- Offline-first architecture

It also works in your browser for quick access without installation.

### Real-time Collaboration

Work together with your team using **Protected Local mode**:

- One user hosts, others connect via WebSocket
- CRDT-based sync (Yjs) ensures conflict-free editing
- See collaborators' cursors and selections in real-time
- Automatic reconnection with offline queue

### Rich Shape Libraries

Create any diagram type with built-in shape libraries:

- **Basic shapes**: Rectangle, Ellipse, Line, Text, Connector, Group
- **Flowchart**: Process, Decision, Terminator, Data, and more
- **UML**: Class, Interface, Use Case, Actor, etc.
- **ERD**: Entity, Relationship, Attribute

Plus, create and share your own **custom shape libraries**.
