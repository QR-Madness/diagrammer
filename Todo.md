## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Backwards Compatibility & Document Safety

**Since v1.0.0-beta.1 is released, all changes MUST be backwards-compatible.**

### Document Safety Requirements
- **Document format changes**: Must include migration code that automatically upgrades older documents
- **Never break existing documents**: Users rely on this tool for critical documentation
- **Test with real documents**: Before merging changes that touch persistence, document loading, or shape data
- **Serialization changes**: Add new fields as optional with sensible defaults; never remove or rename existing fields without migration

### Backwards Compatibility Rules
- **Store changes**: New fields must be optional or have defaults; never break existing localStorage/IndexedDB data
- **Protocol changes**: Maintain compatibility with existing clients; version the protocol if breaking changes are necessary
- **Shape registry**: New shape types are fine; changes to existing shape handlers must preserve rendering of old documents
- **Export formats**: JSON export must remain readable by older versions where possible

### When Breaking Changes Are Unavoidable
1. Implement automatic migration in the loading code
2. Add version field to track document format version
3. Test migration with documents from previous releases
4. Document the migration in release notes

## Completed Phases

Phases 1–16.6 are complete. See [roadmap.md](docs-site/developer/roadmap.md) for full version history.

## Implementation Phase Tracker
### Phase 16.7: Application Backup & Recovery [v1.1.0‑beta.2] ✅

Comprehensive backup system for transferring and recovering all application data.

#### Backup System

- [x] **Full application backup export**
  - Export all local documents as a single archive (.diagrammer-backup or .zip).
  - Include all blob storage (images, icons, embedded files).
  - Include style profiles, color palettes, and custom shape libraries.
  - Include application settings and preferences.
  - Progress indicator for large backups.

- [x] **Backup import/restore**
  - Import backup archive and restore all data.
  - Option to merge with existing data or replace entirely.
  - Conflict resolution UI for duplicate documents/profiles.
  - Validation of backup integrity before restore.

- [x] **Selective backup options**
  - Choose which data to include: documents, blobs, settings, libraries.
  - Per-document export with dependencies (all referenced blobs included).
  - Export selected documents only.

- [x] **Backup UI in Settings**
  - Backup/Restore tab in Settings modal.
  - Last backup timestamp display.
  - Backup size estimation before export.
  - Restore preview showing what will be imported.

### Phase 16.8: Document Archive Export [v1.1.0‑beta.2]

Per-document archive export (`.diagrammer` files) for sharing individual diagrams with all dependencies. Builds on the shared `ArchiveUtils` infrastructure from Phase 16.7.

- [x] **Document archive service**
  - `DocumentArchiveService.exportDocument(docId)` — bundles one document + referenced blobs into a `.diagrammer` archive.
  - `DocumentArchiveService.importDocument(file)` — imports a `.diagrammer` file, creating a new local document with all blobs.
  - Reuses `ArchiveUtils` (ZIP, checksums, blob collection) — no new archive infrastructure needed.
  - Manifest `type: 'diagrammer-document-archive'` distinguishes from full backups.

- [x] **UI integration**
  - "Export as .diagrammer" option in document browser and context menu.
  - "Import .diagrammer" alongside existing JSON import.
  - Replaces/augments current JSON-only export (which loses blob data).

### Phase 17: Embedded Files [RELEASE v1.2.0‑beta.1]

File embedding system for PDFs, spreadsheets, and other assets. Uses reference-based architecture with lazy loading to maintain canvas performance.

#### Architecture Decisions

- **Modal viewer pattern**: Content viewed in modal, not in-place rendered on canvas (preserves 60fps target)
- **Thumbnail on canvas**: Cached preview thumbnail + file icon/name displayed as shape
- **Reference-based storage**: Shapes hold `blobRef` (SHA-256 hash), actual files in BlobStorage
- **Lazy loading tiers**: Off-screen (nothing) → On-screen (thumbnail) → Modal open (full content)
- **Separate blob sync**: HTTP endpoints for large files, WebSocket for shape metadata only

#### Phase 17.1: Core Infrastructure ✅

- [x] **FileShape type definition** (`src/shapes/Shape.ts`)
  - Extends BaseShape with: `blobRef`, `fileName`, `mimeType`, `fileSize`, `fileCategory`

  - Store thumbnail in shape's `preview.thumbnail` field

- [x] **Blob reference tracking**
  - Extended `persistenceStore`, `AssetBundler`, `ArchiveUtils`, `StorageManager`, `StorageSettings`
  - FileShape `blobRef` fields scanned for GC protection

#### Phase 17.2: Content Viewer Modal ✅

- [x] **FileViewerModal component** (`src/ui/FileViewerModal.tsx`)
  - Full-screen modal with close button, download action
  - File type detection and lazy viewer dispatch via `React.lazy()`
  - Double-click on FileShape opens modal (via ToolContext + SelectTool)

- [x] **PDF viewer** (`src/ui/viewers/PdfViewer.tsx`)

  - `sanitizeFileName(name)` — trim, remove path separators, limit length

- [x] **File import service** (`src/services/FileImportService.ts`)
  - `importFiles(files, worldPosition, deps)` pipeline: validate → quota check → blob save → thumbnail → create FileShape → add to document
  - Multi-file grid layout (3 columns), single undo entry, error aggregation, notifications

- [x] **Canvas drag-and-drop** (`src/ui/CanvasContainer.tsx`)
  - Extend `handleDragOver`/`handleDrop` to accept native file drops (`Files` type)
  - Convert screen→world position, call FileImportService
  - Drop zone visual feedback (dashed border overlay)

- [x] **Toolbar file import button** (`src/ui/FileImportButton.tsx`)
  - Hidden `<input type="file" multiple>`, paperclip icon, loading state
  - Add to UnifiedToolbar left section

  - `HEAD /api/blobs/:hash` — Check blob existence
  - Standard HTTP streaming (retry logic handles failed uploads)
  - Authentication via JWT token header

- [x] **Blob sync protocol**
  - On shape sync, client checks if blob exists locally
  - If missing, fetch via HTTP endpoint
  - Progress indicator in status bar during file sync
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff

- [x] **AssetBundler extension**
  - Added `mode` option: 'embed' (base64) or 'reference' (keep hash refs)
  - Reference mode for collaboration (blobs synced via HTTP separately)

#### Phase 17.6: Polish & Edge Cases ✅

### Phase 18.9: Performance & Polish

Improvements deferred from earlier phases for incremental completion.

#### Performance & Optimization

- [ ] **Dirty region tracking for canvas rendering**
  - Currently the entire canvas is redrawn on each frame. Implement a dirty region system that tracks which areas need redrawing.
  - Track bounding boxes of modified shapes and only repaint affected regions.
  - Potential 2-5x performance improvement for large canvases with localized edits.

- [ ] **Shape render caching with OffscreenCanvas**
  - Cache complex shapes (groups with many children, shapes with shadows/patterns) to OffscreenCanvas.
  - Invalidate cache only when shape properties change.
  - Particularly beneficial for groups with background patterns and shadow effects.

- [ ] **Virtual scrolling for LayerPanel**
  - LayerPanel renders all shapes in the DOM, which degrades with 100+ shapes.
  - Implement windowed rendering (react-window or custom) to only render visible items.
  - Include smooth scroll position restoration when collapsing/expanding groups.

#### Stability & Quality

- [ ] **Performance regression benchmarks**
  - Automated benchmark: render 1000/5000/10000 shapes, measure FPS.
  - Track metrics over time to catch regressions.
  - Alert if performance drops below threshold.

- [ ] **Accessibility audit and improvements**

  - New document dialog with template selection.
  - Allow users to save documents as custom templates.

#### Connector & Shape Improvements

- [ ] **Lazy connector route rebuilding** _(Large)_
  - `rebuildAllConnectorRoutes()` rebuilds ALL connectors on any change.
  - Implement incremental updates for only affected connectors.
  - Cache connector routes and invalidate on shape changes.

#### Error Handling & Resilience

- [ ] **Sync operation rollback mechanism**
  - `SelectTool.ts` has TODO: "Revert any in-progress changes" with no implementation.
  - Implement operation rollback for failed multi-step operations.
  - Ensure partial failures don't leave document in inconsistent state.

#### Testing Coverage

- [ ] **Store layer test coverage**
  - `documentStore.ts` - Complex shape manipulation logic untested.
  - `connectionStore.ts` - Connection state transitions tested (26 tests).
  - `teamDocumentStore.ts` - Permission logic and sync flow untested.
  - `persistenceStore.ts` - Document lifecycle operations need coverage.

- [ ] **Edge case test scenarios**
  - Connection loss during active sync operations.
  - Offline queue overflow (100+ pending operations).
  - Concurrent edits on same shape from multiple clients.
  - Shape deletion while connector references it.
  - Group nesting cycle detection.

#### Developer Tooling

- [ ] **Integration test harness** _(Large)_
  - No end-to-end tests for collaborative workflows.
  - Create test utilities for multi-client scenarios.
  - Add CI job for integration test suite.

  - [ ] Run a publish configuration to export various types of media (e.g. PDF, SVG, JSON) to a single, or multiple configured paths on the computer.
  - Keep it extensible to support exporting to cloud locations in the future.

### Future: Document Cloud Providers

- [ ] Implement support

### Future: Comprehensive Local Help System

- [ ] Implement a local help documentation system with integrated search and navigation
- [ ] Create a comprehensive help guide for the application

### Future: Advanced Themes

  - Establish acceptable memory ranges for idle, active editing, and heavy usage
  - Track memory over extended sessions (8+ hours)

- [ ] **Leak detection suite**
  - Create reproducible test scenarios (create/delete pages, add/remove shapes, image upload/delete)
  - Heap snapshot comparison before/after operations
  - Identify retained objects (ProseMirror state, detached DOM, blob URLs)

- [ ] **Platform-specific investigation**

      /docs/diagrammer.json)
- [ ] Feat: Spawn a VS Code instance with access to Git repo

### Future: AI Model Integration

#### Architecture: Semantic Abstraction Layer

AI should reason about **relationships and entities**, not coordinates. The app handles spatial layout.

**AI Output Schema** (no X/Y coordinates):
```typescript
interface AIGraphOutput {
  diagram_type: 'flowchart' | 'erd' | 'class-diagram' | 'sequence' | 'network';
  nodes: Array<{
    id: string;
    type: string;          // maps to shape type
    label: string;
    attributes?: string[]; // for ERD entities, class members, etc.
  }>;
  edges: Array<{
    from: string;          // node id
    to: string;            // node id
    label?: string;
    cardinality?: 'one-to-one' | 'one-to-many' | 'many-to-many';
  }>;
  layout_hint?: 'hierarchical' | 'force-directed' | 'grid' | 'radial';
}
```

**Near-Node Placement** (for incremental edits):
```typescript
interface PlacementHint {
  near: string;                              // existing shape ID or label
  direction: 'above' | 'below' | 'left' | 'right' | 'auto';
  offset?: 'compact' | 'normal' | 'spacious';
}
```

**Layout Engine** converts semantic graph → positioned shapes:
- Hierarchical (dagre): flowcharts, org charts, trees
- Force-directed (d3-force): ERDs, network diagrams
- Near-node resolver: incremental additions with overlap avoidance

  - Structured output schema validation
  - Tool call execution pipeline

- [ ] **AI Assistant Panel** (`src/ui/AIAssistantPanel.tsx`)

  - "Generate Diagram" from description
  - "Improve Selection" for existing shapes
  - "Explain Diagram" for documentation
  - Provider selection in settings

- [ ] **Schema Validator** (`src/services/AISchemaValidator.ts`)
  - Validate node types against shape libraries
  - Map diagram_type to appropriate shapes
  - Graceful fallback for unknown types

- [ ] Add OAuth-based linking for Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox
- [ ] Support read/write of diagrams directly from cloud storage
- [ ] Implement cross-provider sync and conflict resolution

#### Enterprise Plugin System
- [ ] Webhook plugin — outbound event notifications (document created/updated/deleted, user joined/left)
- [ ] Audit log plugin — structured, queryable logs of all document and user events
- [ ] SSO/SAML plugin — integrate with corporate identity providers (Okta, Azure AD, etc.)
- [ ] RBAC plugin — role-based access control for documents, pages, and team workspaces
- [ ] Data retention plugin — configurable retention policies and automated purging
